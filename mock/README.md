# Mock Configuration Files

`mock` doesn't look like it has RHEL10 configs yet... so here's a couple I wrote up based off RHEL9's config to get builds working.

You will also need to copy the RHEL10 RPM GPG key to `/usr/share/        distribution-gpg-keys/redhat/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat10-release` before using my configs.
